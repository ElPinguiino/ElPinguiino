- 👋 Hi, I’m @ElPinguiino
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of stuff from art and music to programming and living off grid, if something is interesting, than I will for sure be intersted!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, django, postgresql, javascript, and react.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of projects that will expand my skillset and knowledge, I consider myself a novice at this point and would like to get to a level where I can build complex web apps by myself.
- 📫 Best way to reach me is through my email, juanjaguilera1@gmail.com
